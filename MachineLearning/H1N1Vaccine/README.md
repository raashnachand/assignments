# H1N1Vaccine

This project for DATA201 showcases how I trained machine learning algorithms to predict whether or not a survey respondent took the H1N1 vaccine. The dataset has many features, such as the respondent's concern level, health behaviours, and opinions on diseases and vaccines.

- `Project.ipnyb`: The Jupyter notebook of my code and report.
- `Project_chandraas.pdf`: The pdf version of the Jupyter notebook.
- `project.pdf`: The project brief.
- `train.csv` and `test.csv`: the training and test datasets, respectively.

Tasks performed:

- Scaling numerical features, encoding nominal and ordinal features
- Using metrics such as accuracy to judge how well a model fits the training set
- Using cross-validation to estimate the performance of a model and measure how precise the estimate is
- Experimenting with feature removal to improve performance measurements
