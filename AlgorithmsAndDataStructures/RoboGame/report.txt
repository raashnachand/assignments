I attempted stages 0-2. I did not use any of my own robot programs to test my parser and execute methods. All the node classes are at the bottom of Parser.java.
The parser works perfect when testing with the provided parser tester. I initially had a problem with something before submitting, but upon writing the problem here, I solved it.
The actual program is also mostly perfect. However, if move() takes additional arguments, the robot just doesn't move at all. Obviously it's a problem with how I set up the EXPR nodes and its children, but my efforts to fix it have failed. I probably need to throw some error to debug it.
