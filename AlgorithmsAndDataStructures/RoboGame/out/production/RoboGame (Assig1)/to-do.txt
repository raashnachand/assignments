To do:
- rework block node to throw error if no statement node detected

Errors parser is throwing:
- Not throwing an error upon finding a colon instead of a semicolon
- Not throwing an error when it finds "turnRight" instead of "turnR"
- Parser breaks when it finds a block with no statements
- Parser does not throw error upon finding an extra close bracket
