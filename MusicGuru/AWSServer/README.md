# AWSServer

A TCP/IPv4 server that a client connects to and requests for a song from a certain year. The
server then returns a random song from the top 10 charts of that year. Present is the code for both the server and the client, the handout showing the requirements for the server and client and instructions for constructing an AWS server to connect to, and images for proof and commentary.
